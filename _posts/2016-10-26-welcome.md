I'm starting a blog to help document some of the problems I have encountered in my career thus far, and how I solved them.  

I'm going to try and keep the content of this blog directed at Junior to Mid level developers that might not have a lot of foundational computer science or mathematics knowledge (since I certainly do not).  This blog will hopefully be easy to approach, and written so that anyone with familiarity of .NET can easily understand.  The problems I detail here will vary, some will be conceptual things that were difficult for me to understand at first, others will be more situational.  My hope is that if other developers encounter similar hurdles, maybe my experiences can help.
