### Welcome

My name is Michelangelo and I feel like I have learned a *ton* so far in my almost 6 year career as a .NET Developer.  This blog is a place for me to document some of the challenges I have encountered, and the solutions I have come up with.  

My hope is that my experiences can be useful to others.
