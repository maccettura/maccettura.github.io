Throughout the course of my work day, I probably think of a dozen or so applications, libraries or tools I could/should write to make my job easier. Once in a while I will go off on an all night adventure, cram learning some new library, banging my head against a desk until 3 AM. After seemingly endless build fails, syntax errors and a severe lack of water or food, I finally finish the task I set out to do. More often than not, this all-night coding adventure does not result in the genius time-save I thought it would be, but I always learn something, and I never regret it.

A little while back, I created <a href="https://fllr.art/" target="_blank">fllr.art</a>. The idea was simple: build an API with a simple URL structure that spits out FPO images. I imagined that this would be a useful tool for anyone who ever needed a quick image, with _specific_ dimensions and didn't want to Google it or pull up an image editor. Originally this was built as a .NET Core project but I recently updated it to utilize some new features of the recently released .NET 6.



<h3>Prettying it up</h3>

I realized that an API hidden among the clouds that only I knew how to use, wasn't super exciting. This is when I decided to finally dive a bit deeper into learning Vue.
